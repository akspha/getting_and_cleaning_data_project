##Code Book for tidy data generated by running run_analysis.R on UCI HAR Dataset


Field names in the tidy data is a subset of the  field names  of the combination of training and testing data from UCI HAR Dataset.
Their names have been changed in order to be consistent with principles of tidy data and a prefix Avg has been furnished
to most field names to denote average of values of corresponding field names in the combination.

Acceptable and descriptive names to fields of the tidy data set by resolving issues like:
	* removing -, (, ), space, redundant numbers which  invalidate variable  names in R and encumber extraction of columns
	* assuring compliance to CamelCase notation

The data (a tidy and modified form of the combination of normalized training and testing data from UCI HAR Dataset)
encodes measurements from accelerometers (from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone) for 30 subjects and the various 
activities they performed during measurements(six activities for each subject).The function aggregate() from
base R was used to obtain averages of extracted columns by crossing activities and subjects to
build this data set.

run_analysis.R extracts column names that contain -mean() or std() as a suffix to implement
"extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement"

Please note: 
There are no units because the dataset was obtained by manipulating a dataset(UCI HAR Dataset)
with normalized values

###Following are the field names:
* Activity

	describes one of the following activities:
	 WALKING,
	 WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
	 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
	 SITTING,
	 STANDING,
	 LAYING


* Subject 

		This field identifies a person for whom measurements were taken via a number.
		There 30 people and each is represented by a unique number from 1 to 30
		
###For the following field names,  excluding Avg, the remainder name is a combination
###of name of a signal and a function computed using those signal values 

* AvgTimeBodyAccMagMean

	Average of means of euclidean norms of body acceleration signal(time signal) 
	
* AvgTimeBodyAccMagStd

	Average of standard deviations of euclidean norms of body acceleration signal(time signal) 
	
* AvgTimeGravityAccMagMean

* AvgFreqBodyGyroMagMean

	Average of means of euclidean norms of signal(time signal) from gyroscope
	
* AvgFreqBodyGyroMagStd 

    Average of standard deviations of euclidean norms of signal(frequency signal) from gyroscope
	
* AvgFreqBodyGyroJerkMagMean

	Average of means of euclidean norms of jerk signal(frequency signal) derived from angular velocity
	
* AvgFreqBodyGyroJerkMagStd 

	Average of standard deviations of euclidean norms of jerk signal(frequency signal) derived from angular velocity

##The dataset so produced has the following attributes:
* One variable per column
* One observation per row
* No NA or NULL values
and can therefore be considered as tidy data.
